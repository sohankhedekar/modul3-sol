      <h3 class="text-center">Phaal Curry</h3>
      <p>Phaal Curry A British-Asian fusion dish, Phaal originated in the Indian restaurants of Birmingham, England, and is considered to be the “big-boy” version of Vindaloo, made spicy by standard-issue chili peppers. Phaal, on the other hand, adds scotch bonnet and sometimes habanero chilis to add an almost unendurable level of heat. For the hottest Phaal imaginable, visit NYC’s Brick Lane Curry House, which uses 10 different types of chili peppers, requires the chef to wear a gas mask during preparation and insists anyone foolish enough to eat this dish agrees to not hold the restaurant responsible for any ensuing gastrointestinal catastrophes. Not so much an entree as a biological weapon.It is one of the hottest forms of curry regularly available, even hotter than the vindaloo, using many ground standard chilli peppers, or a hotter type of chilli such as scotch bonnet or habanero. Typically, the dish is a tomato-based thick curry and includes ginger and optionally fennel seeds.[2]Phall has achieved notoriety as the hottest generally available dish from Indian restaurants. In 2008 in the UK, a charity competition in Hampshire was based on competitors eating increasingly hot phalls.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Suicide Chicken Wings</h3>
      <p>Suicide Chicken Wings  A lot of restaurants offer so-called Suicide Wings, some of which are hot while others will melt your eyeballs. Regardless of the heat level, the secret ingredient in these fiery wings can vary, ranging from habanero sauce to blazing-hot Bhut Jolokia peppers. Regardless of what makes them hot, it goes without saying that it’s always a good idea to exercise caution with any food that has the word “suicide” in its title.Bake chicken wings for 45 minutes at 425 degrees F. Remove wings to crock pot (or drain water from pan and use it). Combine remaining ingredients into sauce and pour over wings. Stir to ensure wings are well coated.Crock pot on low 3 to 4 hours or bake in oven 1 hour at 350 degrees. Reduce chili powder and hot sauce to suit your taste, if needed.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Kimchi jjigae</h3>
      <>Kimchi jjigae is often cooked in Korean homes using older, more fermented and "ripe" kimchi, creating a much stronger taste and containing higher amounts of "good" bacteria (probiotics, also found in yogurt).[3] (Living bacteria in fresh, uncooked kimchi will not survive the cooking process.) The stew is said to be more flavorful if prepared with older kimchi, while fresh kimchi may not bring out a full and rich flavor. Kimchi is the most important ingredient in kimchi jjigae. Other ingredients depend on personal preferences.Sliced kimchi is put into a pot with beef, pork, or seafood; tofu; sliced spring onions; and garlic. They are boiled with water or myeolchi (anchovy) stock. The stew is seasoned with doenjang (bean paste) or gochujang (red pepper paste).[2]Like many other Korean dishes, kimchi jjigae is usually eaten communally from the center of the table if more than two people are served. It is accompanied by banchan (side dishes) and rice. It is usually cooked and served boiling hot in a stone pot.</p>
